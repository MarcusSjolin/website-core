## Current State
Not released, everything is changing constantly

## Vision
Replace current systems out there with a fast and scaleable system which is entirely plugable. 
Meaning there will be plenty of plugins that can achieve tons of cool features.
Plugins can be developed in-house to allow customers of web makers able to download updates and it should give normal web makers the opportunity to produce cool modules for anyone to use!

## Installation
Currently this package includes a very limided "Admin" interface which you can reach at /admin
It won't do much

* `npm install`
* `node index`
* Go to: `http://localhost:8080/admin`

## Plugins
* [website-plugin-admin](https://github.com/MarcusSjolin/website-plugin-admin)
* [website-plugin-webpack](https://github.com/MarcusSjolin/website-plugin-webpack)
